--- The figures referenced in the instructions are located in the README_FIGURES folder. 

1) In DB-Main installation files, under the 'bin' folder, there are two libraries: 
	- jidbm.jar
	- jidbmx.jar
2) Reference the libraries showed above into the dynamicschema.android project as illustrated on figure in file named 'build_path.png'
3) In the project properties, under the Java Build Path window, expand the 'jidbm.jar' entry to specify the native library 
	which is used by 'jidbm.jar', as illustrated on figure 'nativeReference.PNG'
	The native library is called 'jidbm.dll' and is also located under the 'bin' folder of DB-Main.
4) Make sure the schema reifier references the dynamicSchema project as illustrated in figure 'ProjectReference.PNG'
5) Add the full path of the DB-Main 'bin' (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\DB-Main 9.1.5 (DEASY)\bin") 
	and the '/java/jre/bin'(e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\DB-Main 9.1.5 (DEASY)\java\jre\bin)
